Xiang Yu is now faced with an important choice

[[The labyrinth is unfathomable, full of crises inside, and there is a high risk of losing his name, but he chooses to go there in order to save his wife.]]

[[To ensure his safety, Xiang Yu chose not to enter the labyrinth and looked for other ways to save his wife.]]

Turning a corner, an elf leaned against the wall, her long dress torn from her body and her white feathers draped over her back. Her deep eyes are pained, her arm is wounded and blood drips onto the stone floor.

Xiang Yu approached her, his gaze filled with concern and doubt. The elf lifted her head slightly, her voice soft and shaky, "Are you... human?" There was a hint of fear and unease in her tone.

[[Try to approach her and talk to her, "I'm human, are you hurt and need help?"]]

[[You were frightened and chose to turn your head and run.]]


:: Take the trail to go through the treacherous swamps to the legendary Valley of Herbs, where magical, life-saving plants are said to grow. {"position":"925,450","size":"100,100"}

:: Thank the guardian, but you give the elf the herbs to use first and choose to continue exploring the labyrinth. {"position":"2475,75","size":"100,100"}
After you have finished healing the elf's wounds, you decide to continue exploring the depths of the labyrinth, taking the elf with you as you continue on your journey. The passages of the labyrinth are curved and complex, as if trying to challenge your navigational skills. You walk briskly, the light and shadows in front of you are unpredictable, and the air within the labyrinth is filled with a mysterious atmosphere.

Suddenly everything becomes chaotic. You feel dizzy and disoriented, as if you have traveled through a tunnel of time and space. Then your feet hit solid ground and a familiar room comes into view.

You are surprised to find yourself back in your home, the elf gone, but clutching a bouquet of herbs with a mysterious shimmering light in your hand.

[[You rushed to make the herbs first and gave them to your wife.]]

Xiang Yu carefully entered the labyrinth. In the depths of this ancient labyrinth, deep darkness enveloped everything, with only faint lights wavering in the narrow corridors. The walls were suffused with dampness, as if time had stood still here and everything had fallen silent in a terrifying tranquility. Suddenly, he realized that there was a cry for help coming from ahead of him.

[[Gather your courage and check out the place where the distressing sound was made.]]

[[Worrying about fear is a trap, choosing another passage deeper into the labyrinth]]





:: To ensure his safety, Xiang Yu chose not to enter the labyrinth and looked for other ways to save his wife. {"position":"1550,550","size":"100,100"}
You've fought tooth and nail, traveling the world in search of hope that could save her life. You have searched for famous doctors and specialists, and traveled to countless hospitals, each consultation carrying an unending sense of anticipation and anxiety.

Doctors seemed powerless in the face of your wife's rare disease, their tones gradually became heavy and their eyes revealed helplessness. Despite the huge price you have paid, and even exhausting all possible avenues of treatment, the cruelty of life has mercilessly taken away your wife.



:: Try to approach her and talk to her, "I'm human, are you hurt and need help?" {"position":"1975,250","size":"100,100"}
The elf gently walks up to you, one hand clutching the wound, the other trembling slightly.

"Please ...... please help me." Her voice is soft and weak, with a touch of sadness and expectation.

[[You are very kind and choose to bring her home for treatment, but you will not be able to continue your search for herbs]]

[[You turned her down, telling her, "I'm sorry, I need to find the herbs my wife needs." You then leave the elf with some food and improvised medicine and leave.]]

A guardian reveals himself in the deep corridors of the labyrinth, clad in ancient armor and wielding a longsword with an ethereal blue glow. His gaze is wary and he seems to sense your presence.

Despite your valiant attempts to engage the guardian, you find yourself struggling to resist the guardian's formidable power in the darkness deep within the labyrinth. Every attempt to swing your sword is easily deflected by him, and every dodge you make is insightful. The Guardian's attacks seem like a deep darkness that gradually wears you down.

The guardian's gaze reveals a hint of sadness as he says, "Alone, your courage is honorable. However, the power here is beyond your imagination, and you are not ready for this challenge.

[[You are very disappointed to leave the labyrinth]]

Without that mysterious herb, your wife's condition gradually worsens, destroying her fragile body. You can't do anything to witness her weakening day by day, and the pain that sinks into your heart feels like a scar that can't be wiped away.

The torment of the disease eventually caused her to bid farewell to this world.

In the deep labyrinth, you traveled with the wounded elf, healing her wounds along the way. As you are about to reach an important crossroads, a powerful presence emerges from the darkness.

He lapses into a brief moment of contemplation, then removes a bouquet of Xiang Yu herbs with a mysterious shimmering light from the armor on his body.
"Your kindness and goodness have touched me, stranger. This is 'flower of life', which possesses magical healing powers. It can save your wife." 

The guardian solemnly hands the herb over to you.

At this point, the elf's injuries suddenly worsened, and her life was in danger

[[You thank the guardians and choose to return home with the herbs and the elves.]]

The elf's injuries grow worse, her breathing becoming faint and her eyes revealing a fading light. With you unable to do anything to see her off, she eventually passed away quietly in your arms, leaving behind a deep sorrow.

At the same time, the ‘’flower of life‘’ in your hands turned into ashes at this moment.

[[You are very disappointed to leave the labyrinth]]
